Perfect prognosis statistical downscaling relies on statistical relationships established between observational data for both predictands and predictors. Predictors are often retrieved from reanalyses, which are considered as pseudo-observations. The impact of the choice of a reanalysis dataset on the skill of the downscaling method is usually overlooked as global reanalyses are frequently assumed to be equivalent for the last decades and data-rich regions such as Europe. However, it was recently shown that the reanalysis dataset has an impact on the method skill that can be even higher than the choice of the predictor variables. Generally, reanalyses that are processed by more recent atmospheric models and that assimilate more data perform best.

Following the release of ERA5, this work aimed at assessing the extent of the potential gains compared to other global reanalyses. The assessment was carried out using six variants of analog methods, which are statistical downscaling techniques, to predict the daily precipitation at 301 stations in Switzerland. ERA5 ended up among the best performing reanalyses and proved the best choice for 50\% of the stations on average across the different analog methods. We recommend using 20CR-2c for applications starting between 1851 and 1900, CERA-20C for those starting between 1900 and 1950, and ERA5 for applications after 1950.

However, ERA5 is delivered with a high spatial resolution (0.25\degree), which turned out to be a trap for simple calibration techniques. Indeed, the domains over which the predictor fields are compared need to be optimized, and high-resolution grids come along with numerous sub-optimal local minima. An enhanced calibration procedure must thus be used. Besides the risk of poorly-calibrated domains, the high resolution also requires much higher computational time for no gain in skill, as long as the predictors considered are at a synoptic scale. Although ERA5 should be the dataset of choice, its use at a lower resolution to predict daily precipitation should provide equivalent performances.

\section{Introduction}

Analog methods (AMs) are statistical downscaling techniques that predict local meteorological variables, often daily precipitation, based on large-scale predictors. AMs rely on the hypothesis that similar synoptic situations are likely to result in similar local effects, plus a certain variability that is not explained by the considered predictors \citep{Lorenz1969}. To account for this unexplained variability, an ensemble of analog situations is considered. It thus provides a statistical prediction in the form of an empirical conditional distribution made of the corresponding observed predictand values. Multiple variants of the AM exist, eventually with different structures and approaches, but mainly with different predictors.

Application of AMs consist, for example, in daily precipitation predictions, either in an operational forecasting context \citep[e.g.][]{Bontron2005, Hamill2006, Bliefernicht2010, Marty2012, Horton2012, Hamill2015, BenDaoud2016} or for downscaling climate models \citep[e.g.][]{Zorita1999, Wetterhall2005, Wetterhall2007, Matulla2007, Radanovics2013, Chardon2014, Dayon2015, Raynaud2016b}. Other applications focus on precipitation radar images \citep{Panziera2011, Foresti2015a}, temperature \citep{Kruizinga1983, DelleMonache2013, Caillouet2016, Raynaud2016b}, wind \citep{DelleMonache2013, DelleMonache2011, Vanvyve2015, Alessandrini2015, Junk2015, Junk2015c}, solar radiation or power production \citep{Alessandrini2015a, Bessa2015, Raynaud2016b}, and the trajectory of tropical cyclones \citep{Sievers2000, Fraedrich2003}. AMs are also used for seasonal forecast \citep{Xavier2007, Charles2012, Wu2012, Shao2013}.

AMs are most often developed in a perfect prognosis framework \citep{Rummukainen1997, Maraun2010}, where the statistical relationship is calibrated between large-scale and local-scale observations. In this context, global reanalyses are the datasets of choice for the large-scale variables as they provide multivariate gridded outputs that are physically consistent and available all around the globe \citep{Gelaro2017}. Globally, two main types of reanalysis products exist: those that aim for homogeneity over a long period -- starting at the beginning of the 20th century -- and hence assimilate surface data only, and those that aim for accuracy over a more recent period and therefore assimilate a maximum of observations, including multiple satellite products. The reanalyses accuracy depends on the quality of the model physics and the analysis process, thus on the quantity and quality of the assimilated observations \citep{Dee2011a}.

The context of the application can drive the choice of a reanalysis dataset to be used in AMs. For example, if a coverage of the 20th century is needed, ECMWF twentieth century reanalyses \citep[ERA-20C or CERA-20C --][]{Poli2016, Laloyaux2016} or the Twentieth Century Reanalysis \citep[20CR --][]{Compo2011} produced by NOAA can be used \citep[for example,][]{Kuentz2015, Caillouet2016, Brigode2016, Bonnet2017}. In an operational forecasting context, with the target situation being provided by an NWP model, one should prefer a reanalysis that is produced by the same NWP model as the operational forecast to reduce the inter-models biases. However, in many cases, the selection of the reanalysis is arbitrary and might be driven by a preference for the local provider.  

NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 \citep[NR-1 --][]{Kalnay1996, Kistler2001} and NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 \citep[NR-2 --][]{Kanamitsu2002} were used in many applications of AMs \citep[e.g.][]{Timbal2003, Altava-Ortiz2006, Matulla2007, Yiou2014}. ERA-40 \citep{Uppala2005}, produced by ECMWF, has also been used substantially \citep[e.g.][] {Willems2011b, Radanovics2013, Chardon2014, BenDaoud2016}. Its sucessor, ERA-Interim \citep[ERA-INT --][]{Dee2011a}, has been used by \cite{Raynaud2016b}. NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications \citep[MERRA -- ][]{Rienecker2011} has been used by \citet{Vanvyve2015}. The Japanese products, the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis \citep[JRA-55 --][]{Kobayashi2015, Harada2016} and its conventional-only JRA-55 Conventional \citep[JRA-55C --][]{Kobayashi2014}, were not used in AMs to the author knowledge. Newer products, such as NCEP's the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis \citep[CFSR --][]{Saha2010a}, MERRA version 2 \citep[MERRA-2 -- ][]{Gelaro2017}, or ERA5 \citep{Hersbach2019}, are not much used yet in AMs. One can often observe a lag between the release of a new reanalysis dataset and its adoption in AMs.

Most applications of AMs are based on a single reanalysis dataset, and the impact of this choice is overlooked. \citet{BenDaoud2009} compared NR-1 to ERA-40 and found no significant difference for the predictors considered. Later, \citet{Dayon2015} compared NR-1, MERRA, ERA-INT, and 20CR and found out that the choice of the reanalysis dataset has a non-negligible impact on the performance of the AMs that can even be greater than the choice of the predictor variables. They concluded that the role of the reanalyses should not be underestimated. Such influence has also been observed for other statistical downscaling methods \citep[e.g.][]{Koukidis2009}. \citet{Horton2018b} compared ten global reanalyses and concluded that the impact of the dataset on the results of the AM is significant. As in the work of \citet{Dayon2015}, the impact of the reanalysis was found to be sometimes higher than that of the selected predictors. 

Generally, more recent products that assimilate more data and that come at a higher spatial resolution show better skills \citep{Horton2018b}. However, this is not systematically the case, as for example, JRA-55, which has a lower spatial resolution (1.25\degree), turned out to be among the best options for more complex AMs. Also, the choice of a reanalysis can be driven by the period of interest. As there was no overall better dataset, a table has been provided by \citet{Horton2018b} as a guidance for the selection of a reanalysis for a given predictor and a given period. Some characteristics of the datasets were also assessed, such as the spatial resolution, the archive length, and the use of ensemble members. For most AMs and datasets, there was a gain in skill with higher resolution up to 1\degree, below which the gains were almost null. The use of long archives for reanalyses with extended data improved the skill to some extent by providing potentially better analog situations, particularly for less frequent situations. However, former times are more data-scarce, and data might be inhomogeneous over long periods, which can, in turn, have a negative effect on the skill of AMs exploiting these archives \citep{Horton2018b}. Finally, the use of ensemble members showed limited benefits and great caution is required for methods with multiple levels of analogy.

This work is a follow-up of the work of \citet{Horton2018b} and focuses on ERA5 by comparing its impact in six AMs with nine other major reanalyses at 301 stations in Switzerland. The analyses of the characteristics of the reanalyses as in \citet{Horton2018b} were not repeated here as the conclusions are likely identical. The optimal parameters, such as the number of analogs and the size of the comparison domain, were compared among reanalysis and discussed, which provides an original insight on the role of the spatial resolution and the reanalysis quality. The benefit of ERA5 high spatial resolution and its potential pitfalls are also assessed.


\section{Data and methods}
\label{sec:data_methods}

\subsection{Reanalyses}
\label{sec:reanalyses}

The present work aims at comparing ERA5 \citep{Hersbach2019} to other global reanalyses, which characteristics are provided in Table \ref{table:datasets}, to complement the work of \citet{Horton2018b}. The three first reanalyses in Table \ref{table:datasets} are surface-input \citep{Fujiwara2017} products that assimilate surface data only but cover an extended period, typically the 20th century. NOAA produced the Twentieth Century Reanalysis \citep[version 2c, 20CR-2c --][]{Compo2011}, which only assimilates surface pressure data and uses observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) developed two products using surface-input only. The first is ERA-20C \citep{Poli2016}, which assimilates marine wind observations and is forced by sea surface temperature, sea ice cover, atmospheric composition changes, and solar forcing. The second is CERA-20C \citep{Laloyaux2018a}, which has an additional coupling to the ocean and was produced by a more recent version of the Integrating Forecasting System (IFS) model.

The other reanalyses are full-input products that assimilate all available data, including satellite data \citep{Fujiwara2017}. NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I \citep[NR-1 --][]{Kalnay1996, Kistler2001} was the first global reanalysis, followed by NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 \citep[NR-2 --][]{Kanamitsu2002} that fixed some identified problems. The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis \citep[CFSR --][]{Saha2010a} is the most recent reanalysis by NCEP. The Japanese 55-year Reanalysis \citep[JRA-55 --][]{Kobayashi2015, Harada2016} is produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Its version using conventional data only, JRA-55 Conventional \citep[JRA-55C --][]{Kobayashi2014}, was not considered in this work as it provides similar results as JRA-55 \citep{Horton2018b}. NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) released the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 \citep[MERRA-2 -- ][]{Gelaro2017}, which is an improvement of the first MERRA reanalysis \citep{Rienecker2011}. Finally, the predecessor of ERA5, ERA-Interim \citep[ERA-INT --][]{Dee2011a}, was also considered.

ERA5 \citep{Hersbach2019} is meant to replace ERA-Interim. It benefits from multiple improvements to IFS, in terms of model physics, core dynamics, and data assimilation \citep{Hersbach2019}. It provides more outputs, with higher temporal (hourly) and spatial (0.25\degree) resolutions. It is to date the reanalysis with the highest spatial and temporal resolution. The use of a 10-members ensemble of data assimilation at a lower spatial and temporal resolution allows an estimation of the uncertainty. ERA5 assimilates significantly more data than ERA-Interim, such as ground-based radar and new satellite sensors, and uses improved observation operators, allowing better comparison of model outputs with observations. Additionally, it indirectly benefits from improvements of historical observations, both for conventional and satellite data \citep{Hersbach2019}. ERA5 provides, among others, more consistent sea surface temperature and sea ice, an improved representation of tropical cyclones, a better balance of evaporation and precipitation, and improved soil moisture. ERA5 is also more suitable for climate analyses as it relies on appropriate radiative forcing and boundary conditions (e.g., changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, SST, and sea ice).

\subsection{Precipitation dataset}
\label{sec:precipitation}

The local variables to be predicted are here daily precipitation totals (06:00~h~UTC to 06:00~h~UTC the following day) at 301 stations of the MeteoSwiss network in Switzerland (Fig. \ref{fig:stations}), with good coverage of the 1981--2010 period. The 30-year precipitation dataset was divided into a calibration period (CP) and an independent validation period (VP), which was evenly distributed over the entire series (1 year out of every 5; a total of 6 years). The archive period (AP), in which the analog dates are being retrieved, is the same as the CP -- also with the VP being excluded -- with an additional exclusion of $\pm30$ days around the target date. The results below are always shown for the VP.


\subsection{Analog methods}
\label{sec:ams}

Most AMs variants from the analysis of \cite{Horton2018b} were considered here (Table \ref{table:methods}). These AMs have different degrees of complexity, but they all start with a preselection to cope with seasonality. A commonly used preselection is based on calendar dates (PC: preselection on a calendar basis in Table \ref{table:methods}) as candidate situations are extracted from the archive for a period of 120~days centered around the target date. To allow for a more dynamic approach, \citet{BenDaoud2016} base this preselection on the similarity of air temperature (T) at 925~hPa and 600~hPa at the nearest grid point. A resulting undesired mixing of spring and autumn situations is discussed in \citet{Caillouet2016}.

	\end{threeparttable}
	\label{table:methods}
\end{table*}

All considered AMs have a first level of analogy based on the atmospheric circulation, using the geopotential height (Z) at different pressure levels and time as predictor. This analogy is quantified by the S1 criterion \citep[Eq.\ \ref{eq:S1}, ][]{Teweles1954, Brown2012}, which is a comparison of gradients over a selected (calibrated) domain. The S1 criterion allows comparing the atmospheric circulation instead of the absolute values of the respective fields. The S1 values processed for different levels/hours are averaged into a single value. More advanced approaches introduce a weighting between these components \citep{Horton2017a}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:S1}
	S1=100 \frac{\sum_{i} \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} - \Delta z_{i} \vert}{\sum_{i} \max\left\lbrace \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} \vert; \vert \Delta z_{i} \vert \right\rbrace }
	% use \displaystyle to max sum sign larger
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \hat{z}_{i}$ is the geopotential height gradient between the \textit{i}-th pair of points for the target day, and $\Delta z_{i}$ is the corresponding observed geopotential height gradient for the candidate situation. The smaller the value S1 is, the more similar the pressure fields.

The most simple method, 2Z, is based on the analogy of the atmospheric circulation alone, using the geopotential height at 1000~hPa and 500~hPa \citep{Bontron2004}. The most similar $N_{1}$ dates with the lowest values of S1 are selected as analogs to the target date. The daily precipitation that was measured at these $N_{1}$ dates then provides the empirical conditional distribution, considered as the probabilistic prediction for the target date.

The second method, 4Z, is also based on geopotential heights only, but using four combinations of pressure levels and temporal windows \citep{Horton2018a}. This method is here considered as a simplified version of a more sophisticated method elaborated by genetic algorithms. It was found that using four geopotential heights is more informative than using two \citep{Horton2018a}.

Then, the next three methods (2Z-2MI, 4Z-2MI, PT-2Z-4MI, Table \ref{table:methods}) add a second level of analogy based on moisture variables to subsample from the first level. The predictor for this second level of analogy is a moisture index (MI), which is the product of the total precipitable water (TPW) and the relative humidity (RH) and was introduced by \citet{Bontron2004}. This predictor is assessed using the root mean square error (RMSE) criterion. The 2Z-2MI method \citep{Bontron2004} uses this index at 850~hPa for two different hours (+12 h and +24 h). The 4Z-2MI method \citep{Horton2018a}, derived from optimizations with genetic algorithms, uses the moisture index at 600~hPa and 700~hPa, with a change in the selected levels of the geopotential height compared to 4Z. The 4Z-2MI method \citep{BenDaoud2016} considers the moisture index at 700~hPa and 925~hPa, both at +12 h and +24 h.

Finally, the most complex method, PT-2Z-4W-4MI, also named "SANDHY" for Stepwise Analogue Downscaling method for Hydrology \citep{BenDaoud2016, Caillouet2016}, adds an intermediate level of analogy, before the moisture predictors, based on the vertical velocity (W) at 850~hPa. It was primarily developed for large and relatively flat/lowland catchments in France (Sa\^{o}ne, Seine).


\subsection{Calibration of the methods} %\subsubsection?
\label{sec:calibration}

The Continuous Ranked Probability Score \citep[CRPS,][]{Brown1974, Matheson1976, Hersbach2000} is often used as the performance metric for AMs as it allows evaluating the predicted cumulative distribution provided by the analogs with regards to the single observed value at the target date. Its skill score expression, the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS), was used here, using the climatological distribution of precipitation at each station as the reference. It allows a better comparison among stations as it takes into account the differences in climatology to some extent. The CRPSS is expressed as follows \citep{Bradley2011}:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:CRPSS}
	CRPSS = 1-\frac{\overline{CRPS}}{\overline{CRPS}_{clim}}
\end{equation}
where $CRPS_{clim}$ is the CRPS value for the climatological distribution. A better prediction is characterized by an increase in CRPSS.

The methods were calibrated using the semi-automatic sequential procedure developed by \citet{Bontron2004} and also used in \citet{Radanovics2013} and \citet{BenDaoud2016}. It allows calibrating the spatial windows on which the predictors are compared (specific to each level of analogy) and the number of analog dates to select for the different levels of analogy. The procedure starts with the calculation of the relevance map, which consists of assessing the skill of all points of the predictor grid within a predefined domain. The spatial windows are then calibrated by incremental increases starting from the data point(s) with the highest skill. Increases are assessed in the four directions, and the most skilful move is retained. The procedure stops when increasing the domain does not improve the skill. The number of analogs is calibrated jointly for all levels of analogy, once the spatial windows are calibrated, by assessing multiple combinations. A detailed description can be found in \citet{Horton2019}. 

After the initial calibration of all AMs for ERA5, some issues were identified with the spatial windows (shown and discussed in section \ref{sec:results_hires}). These were due to some limitations of the calibration technique related to the high-resolution grid. The calibration procedure was then repeated using an improvement of the semi-automatic technique, named classic+ \citep{Horton2019}, which allows additional moves in the calibration of the spatial windows and thus allows escaping local minima to some extent. The additional moves are (1) an increase in two simultaneous directions, (2) a decrease in one or two simultaneous directions, (3) expansion or contraction (in every direction), (4) a shift of the window (without resizing) in eight directions (including diagonals), and finally (5) all the moves described above, but with a factor of 2, 3, or more (3 was considered as the maximum here). These additional moves can help jump above local optima, but do not guarantee optimal spatial windows. Another advantage of the classic+ calibration is that it does not assess all grid points when processing the relevance map (identification of the most skilled point), which results in a substantial time-saving.

The AtmoSwing software \citep{Horton2019} was used to perform these calibrations. The calculations were performed on an HPC cluster at the University of Bern. The calibration was done independently for every station, method, and reanalysis. It means that the spatial windows and number of analogs of AMs differ from a reanalysis to another, and thus, these changes will impact the selection of the analog dates. The a priori selection of common spatial windows would not have been possible due to differences in grid resolutions (e.g. MERRA-2 does not overlap easily with the other grids), and it would not have been fair for reanalyses for which optimal windows differ from the pre-selected ones. With independent calibrations, all spatial windows should be optimal for the reanalysis at hand, and thus the comparison between reanalyses more accurate.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The results are provided for the VP (independent validation period, Sect. \ref{sec:precipitation}). All reanalyses were used at their highest available spatial resolution and at a 6-hourly time step. The results for the other reanalyses than ERA5 were taken from the work of \citet{Horton2018b}.


\subsection{High spatial resolution: pitfalls and impact on performance}
\label{sec:results_hires}

Although the calibrations have been performed on an HPC cluster, they ended up being highly time-consuming for ERA5 when using the classic calibration (Sect. \ref{sec:calibration}). The reason is that the process involves calculating a relevance map for each level of analogy, which requires an assessment of every unitary cell of the predictor grid, and the assessment of successive extensions of the spatial window in the four directions. On a high-resolution grid, these procedures imply numerous assessments.

The first results of the classic calibration showed that ERA5 (grayed bars in Fig. \ref{fig:resolution}) underperformed ERA-INT. An analysis of the resulting parameters revealed that the spatial windows for Z were significantly smaller for ERA5 compared to the other reanalyses. For example, for 2Z, the mean zonal and meridional extents of the spatial windows were less than half those for ERA-INT. In general, the spatial windows for Z when using ERA5 were very small, and in contrast, the number of analogs was higher than for ERA-INT. The reason for such non-optimal parameters is due to the classic calibration being stuck in local minima during the procedure of the spatial window expansion, as none of the increments in the four directions resulted in a gain in skill. This issue did not happen in a significant way for the other reanalyses and is here due to the high resolution of ERA5. High resolution generates a noisier response surface in terms of skill, with local minima that can trap the classic calibration. To address this issue, the classic+ calibration (Sect. \ref{sec:calibration}) was then used. It allows additional moves in the growth of the spatial windows, including increases of multiple grid points at once to get out of local minima. The classic+ calibration also ended up being faster as it does not assess every grid point when calculating the relevance map. A global optimization technique, such as genetic algorithms \citep{Horton2017a}, would even more efficiently overcome this issue. However, they are generally computationally intensive and too time consuming for this comparison work. With the advent of high-resolution datasets, one should be aware of the potential pitfalls of calibration techniques that were developed on low-resolution datasets

\citet{Horton2018b} showed that below 1\degree, the spatial resolution of the reanalyses generally has no significant impact on the performance of AMs. It is because, e.g., the geopotential at 500~hPa has a half-autocorrelation distance of about 1000~km \citep{Thiebaux1985}, and thus, the high resolution does not bring new information. It might, however, be different for moisture variables. ERA5 has the highest spatial resolution (0.25\degree) among global reanalyses. An additional calibration was performed using the same resolution as ERA-INT (0.75\degree) to quantify the contribution of the resolution to the gain in skill. Fig. \ref{fig:resolution} shows that degrading the resolution of ERA5 to ERA-INT resolution (named ERA5 0.75 in Fig. \ref{fig:resolution}) did not significantly impact the score. Although a higher model resolution is likely contributing to the improvements of ERA5 compared to ERA-INT, the high output resolution has no significant impact on AMs performance for the prediction of daily precipitation. We would have expected to see some gains for moisture variables, but they did not materialize. The gains relatively to ERA-INT are thus likely due to improvements in the forecast model, the assimilation scheme, and the assimilated data. While this conclusion is likely valid for predictands principally driven by large-scale predictors, it cannot be transposed to all applications. Indeed, when the phenomenon at hand is mainly driven by mesoscale predictors, such as lightning activity, the output spatial resolution does matter (unpublished results).


\subsection{Comparing resulting parameters across reanalyses}
\label{sec:results_parameters}

Every AM has been calibrated independently for each reanalysis to be optimal for each configuration. In consequence, the resulting parameters differ from a setup to another. The parameters that were calibrated here are the number of analogs (Fig. \ref{fig:params-nb-analogs}) and the spatial windows on which the predictor fields are compared (Fig. \ref{fig:params-xwidth} for the zonal extent and Fig. \ref{fig:params-ywidth} for the meridional extent). Substantial differences can be observed among the resulting parameters.

The number of analogs varies non-homogeneously among methods and datasets (Fig. \ref{fig:params-nb-analogs}). For methods with a single level of analogy (2Z and 4Z), the three reanalyses with the lowest spatial resolution and the poorest prediction skill (Sect. \ref{sec:results_skill}) are characterized by a higher number of analogs, while the other datasets show similar distribution. A higher number of analogs can be related to the size of the spatial window and thus the spatial resolution, but it was also shown to be linked with the skill of the prediction and thus the quality of the dataset \citep{Horton2017b}. However, this cannot be transposed to all levels of analogy of more complex methods as interactions between these levels result in more complex behaviour. For example, while there is no clear trend for the number of analogs for the atmospheric circulation (first level of analogy) in 2Z-2MI and 4Z-2MI, PT-2Z-4MI shows an inverse trend, i.e. more skilled datasets being related to a higher number of analogs on the first level of analogy (Z). This method emphasizes more moisture predictors, with four predictors being used in the second level of analogy. A likely reason for such an inverted tendency comes from better moisture variables. It is important to remember here that the number of analogs of each level of analogy is optimized jointly at the end of the calibration procedure by assessing multiple combinations. Thus, datasets with better moisture variables in the second level of analogy benefit from discriminating the analog candidates by making more use of these instead of circulation variables and thus keep a higher number of analogs from the first level of analogy. The same pattern can be observed for PT-2Z-4W-4MI, the most complex method, for Z and even more so for W. These selections of larger samples of analog dates based on circulation variables correspond to datasets with higher spatial resolution and better skill, but only happen when the method has multiple levels of analogy. This suggests that parameters might not be optimal when transferred from one reanalysis to another, and that one should be careful when manually adapting parameters as the direction of change can be counter-intuitive. Moreover, some distributions are highly spread out, which makes the generalization of parameter values more difficult. However, the number of analog distributions for the last level of analogy are unimodal and less spread out than for prior levels of analogy.

The zonal extents of the spatial windows (Fig. \ref{fig:params-xwidth}) also show substantial differences among datasets depending on the AM. For circulation-only AMs (2Z and 4Z), the zonal extent tends to decrease with an increase in the spatial resolution of the reanalysis, even more so when four geopotential fields are considered (4Z). Also, all spatial windows tend to be substantially smaller for 4Z than for 2Z, with mean values halved for some datasets. Unlike the number of analogs, the spatial windows were calibrated sequentially for each level of analogy, without posterior re-calibrations. This results in distributions of the zonal extent of geopotential height fields that are relatively similar between the first level of analogy of more complex methods and AM based on Z only. Some variations can be observed and are due to different initial numbers of analogs at the start of the calibration procedure for 2Z-2MI and 4Z-2MI, as well as a different preselection of the candidate analogs for PT-2Z-4MI and PT-2Z-4W-4MI (based on temperature instead of a calendar preselection). This similarity of the spatial windows among AMs does not hold anymore when using a global optimization technique that optimizes all parameters of the different levels of analogy jointly, as spatial windows of the circulation variables are reduced when moisture variables are used on a second level of analogy  \citep{Horton2018a}. Similar zonal extents among the methods does not here correspond to an optimal, but to a limitation of the sequential calibration procedure that can only be overcome by a global optimization technique.

Moisture variables and vertical velocity are local variables that are characterized by smaller spatial windows \citep{BenDaoud2016, Horton2018a}. Their zonal extent decreases with the spatial resolution of the reanalysis, except for MERRA-2 when four moisture variables are used (the reason has not been investigated). Also, the zonal extents of W are noticeably smaller than those of moisture variables for reanalyses with high resolution, i.e. CFSR and ERA5. Finally, while the distributions of the zonal extents are mostly unimodal for W and MI, higher resolution datasets show multimodal distributions for Z. Similarly to the number of analogs, the differences of the optimal spatial windows for the different reanalyses raise caution about the transferability of parameters among datasets. \citet{Horton2019} showed that the spatial windows have better be larger than too small, and it would thus be safer to transfer larger spatial windows from one dataset to another rather than the opposite. 

The meridional extents of the spatial windows (Fig. \ref{fig:params-ywidth}) show similarity with the zonal extents in that MI and W are characterized by smaller extents than Z, with W being assessed on very small windows for CFSR and ERA5, and MERRA-2 is diverging from the trend when four moisture variables are used. In contrast to the zonal extents, the meridional extents for Z do not show a clear trend with the spatial resolution. Also, when using more geopotential heights (from 2Z to 4Z), the meridional extent is not substantially reduced for most reanalyses, to the contrary of the zonal extent. The meridional extents show distributions that differ among datasets with no unique optimal range for Z. 

The frequency of spatial windows for Z with very small zonal or meridional extents is relatively high, all the more for higher resolution datasets. However, for most stations and reanalyses, these small values do not co-occur, i.e. they represent narrow and elongated spatial windows rather than small squared domains (not shown). Furthermore, when one dimension is small (zonal or meridional), the other can be located in the upper part of the distribution. For example, the spatial windows with a minimal meridional extent for 4Z have a zonal extent mostly between 7 and 10\degree\ for ERA5. This is even more pronounced for PT-2Z-4W-4MI, where almost all the meridional extents above 8\degree\ correspond to very small zonal extents. However, the opposite is not true for this method, as the very small meridional extents correspond to zonal extents between 5 and 8\degree, so below the average. Three datasets (CERA-20C, ERA-INT, MERRA-2) show relatively small extents jointly in both directions for Z in PT-2Z-4W-4MI. The parameters for these methods were calibrated using the classic calibration instead of the classic+ version (Sect. \ref{sec:calibration}), and they may represent local non-optimal solutions. 

As for the thin zonally or meridionally elongated spatial windows, we cannot exclude that they result from limitations of the classic(+) calibration technique. However, it is interesting to note that the use of a global optimization technique (genetic algorithms) also resulted in some narrow and zonally elongated spatial windows \citep{Horton2018a}. Additionally, there are spatial patterns among the corresponding station locations showing some consistency with the different climatic regions in Switzerland. Here, depending on the reanalysis, the zonally elongated spatial windows are dominant for stations located in the southern part of Switzerland, where southerly circulation is responsible for the most extreme precipitation events, and meridionally elongated spatial windows are much present in regions where westerlies are associated with heavy rainfall. While some optimal spatial windows for processing the gradients of the geopotential height are relatively large and rectangular, the relevance of narrow and elongated spatial windows perpendicular to the flux associated with heavy precipitation can not be discarded.


\subsection{How does ERA5 compare to other reanalyses?}
\label{sec:results_skill}

The skill scores of the different methods and reanalyses are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_values}. As discussed in \citet{Horton2018b}, there are clear differences among methods as more complex AMs generally perform better, but also among reanalyses in favor of modern full-input reanalyses. ERA5 is here systematically in the best performing reanalyses. When isolating the impact of the reanalysis by removing the influence of the methods and the stations (Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_relative}), the positive contribution of ERA5 to the skill score is even more clear. ERA5 show superior skills for 2Z and relatively similar skills as CFSR, which has the second highest spatial resolution, for 4Z. Overall, the impact of the reanalyses tends to increase with the method complexity. While ERA-INT was already performing well for complex methods, ERA5 show even more skill. Thus, it surpasses all other reanalyses for 2Z-2MI and shows the largest difference for the method PT-2Z-4MI. Similarly to 4Z, it is on par with CFSR for the method 4Z-2MI. Interestingly, JRA-55 show similar skills as ERA5 for the most complex method, PT-2Z-4W-4MI, although JRA-55 has an output resolution that is five times lower (1.25\degree) than ERA5.

ERA5 was selected as the best reanalysis for about 50\% of the stations on average, with a minimum of 34.9\% for 4Z and a maximum of 78.7\% for PT-2Z-4MI. When considering the first two ranks, ERA5 was selected for 75\% of the stations on average, with a minimum of 61.8\% for PT-2Z-4W-4MI and a maximum of 91.7\% for PT-2Z-4MI. There were no specific spatial patterns as to which stations performed best with ERA5, such as was the case with other reanalyses in \citet{Horton2018b}. Even though ERA5 did not systematically supersede ERA-INT for all stations, its performance is overall superior, and we would recommend using it. Moreover, ERA-INT being discontinued, ERA5 is an obvious choice in most applications.

The use of predictors from different datasets and with distinct spatial windows results in a different selection of analog dates. The percentage of identical analog dates for the different AMs over the VP is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:shared-dates}. This percentage decreases with the complexity of the AM and ranges from a maximum of 74\% between NR-1 and NR-2 for the 2Z method to a minimum of 10\% between MERRA-2 and 20CR-2c for the PT-2Z-4W-4MI method. If all reanalyses were compared over the same spatial windows, these numbers would likely be higher.

As it could be expected, ERA5 shared some similarities in the selection of analog dates with ERA-INT, but not to an extent that is significantly different from the other modern full-input reanalyses. Indeed, the percentage of shared analog dates is of the same order of magnitude as with CFSR and JRA-55, which are the two reanalyses produced by models with a high spatial resolution (Table \ref{table:datasets}), but with fewer vertical levels. It is worth noting that JRA-55 presents strong similarities with ERA5 in terms of selected analog dates for Switzerland, which is consistent with their relatively similar performance, mainly for PT-2Z-4W-4MI.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The choice of a reanalysis has a significant impact on the performance of AMs in the perfect prognosis context, as already shown in the work of \citet{Dayon2015} and \citet{Horton2018b} for the European region. The impact of the dataset on AMs skills can be higher than that of the choice of the predictor variables. \citet{Horton2018b} concluded that, as a general rule, the latest version of the full-input reanalyses should be used as they contribute to better skill. The subsequent release of ERA5 then raised the question of its potential benefits over ERA-INT and the extent to which the high spatial resolution could be informative for statistical downscaling.

This work focused on comparing ERA5 to the other main global reanalyses and showed that it should be the dataset of choice for all tested AMs as it often surpassed the other reanalyses. ERA5 was selected as the best dataset by about 50\% of the stations and was in one of the two first ranks for 75\% of them. Even though ERA5 might not be systematically the best reanalysis for all stations, it is constantly among the bests and thus should be used for AMs in Switzerland and likely more globally in Europe. However, for certain applications, it would be advisable not to use a single but a selection of different-enough reanalyses to account for their relative uncertainties.

ERA5 is provided at high spatial (0.25\degree) and temporal (1~h) resolutions. Although AMs are computationally light approaches, their calibration over several decades can be time-consuming. This time increases all the more with a higher spatial resolution of the predictor grids. The high resolution even turned into a trap for the calibration technique that ended up stuck in local minima, resulting in poor skills. When using high-resolution predictor grids, one should ensure that the calibration technique used can satisfactorily optimize the spatial windows. The classic+ calibration \citep{Horton2019} was here able to successfully calibrate the spatial windows thanks to additional moves that allow going out of local minima.

We also showed that the optimal spatial windows and number of analogs differ among reanalyses. The number of analogs is often related to the size of the spatial window and thus the spatial resolution, as well as to the skill of the dataset (or method). A lower number of analogs in the last level of analogy is usually associated with a better skill of the reanalysis. However, the opposite can be observed for intermediate levels of analogy, where a higher number of analogs can be selected on circulation variables to leverage better moisture variables in a subsequent level of analogy. Thus, one should take care when manually selecting the number of analogs as the best solution can be counter-intuitive.

The spatial windows were shown to vary substantially among reanalyses. Spatial windows generally tend to decrease with an increase in the spatial resolution of the reanalysis. Narrow and elongated spatial windows were sometimes observed for the geopotential height at some stations when using datasets with a high spatial resolution, which differ from the traditional spatial windows of rather square shape. Although a limitation of the calibration procedure cannot be excluded, the orientation of these windows perpendicular to the flux associated with heavy precipitation for the given stations suggests a relevance that cannot be discarded either. Overall, the differences in the optimal spatial windows and number of analogs among reanalyses raise caution about the transferability of parameters among datasets.

\citet{Horton2018b} showed that using reanalyses at a spatial resolution inferior to  1\degree\ did not significantly improve the performance score. ERA5 was here used at its original resolution as well as with the same resolution as ERA-INT (0.75\degree). The reduction in spatial resolution did not impact the performance of AMs for daily precipitation, here mainly driven by synoptic-scale processes. This conclusion was shown to be not valid for predictands driven by mesoscale drivers, such as the lightning activity. It also implies that the output resolution does not explain the gains in skill compared to ERA-INT, which are likely due to improvements to the forecast model, the assimilation scheme, and the assimilated data.

To conclude, ERA5 is recommended for the prediction of daily precipitation with AMs in Europe, ideally along with other reanalyses to provide a multi-model approach. ERA5 was shown to be systematically among the best options for each AM, and thus there is no need for a predictor-conditioned selection as in \citet{Horton2018b}. We recommend using 20CR-2c for applications starting between 1851 and 1900, CERA-20C for those starting between 1900 and 1950, and ERA5 for applications after 1950. However, for predictands primarily driven by synoptic-scale processes, using ERA5 at its full resolution is not justified and might even be counterproductive if the calibration method does not handle it well.
